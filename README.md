# QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is my first challenge from [Frontend Mentor], and it's a solution to the **QR Code Component** project.

The goal was to build a simple, responsive component that displays a QR code and some supporting text.

Thanks to Frontend Mentor for providing this great opportunity to practice and improve my frontend skills!
